# Deliverables Mapping and Checklist

This file maps the project deliverables (as requested) to files and artifacts in this repository and lists missing items or recommended next steps. Use this as the index for assembling the final report.

## Deliverables (requested)
1. Title of the problem statement with Team details (Cover page)
   - Create a cover page in the report PDF or include as `COVER_PAGE.md` (not currently present).

2. Description about the statement (Short abstract)
   - Use `PROJECT_REPORT.md` and `PROJECT_REPORT_PART2.md` as starting points. Update with final abstract if needed.

3. User requirement specification in detail (prepared for review-1)
   - Present in `USER_REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` (this file was just created).

4. List of Softwares/Tools/Programming languages used
   - Recommend adding a small section to `README.md` or `PROJECT_REPORT_PART2.md`. Current project uses: Python (3.x), Streamlit, MySQL (mysql-connector-python), pandas.

5. ER Diagram
   - Not present as an image. Options:
     - Add `ER_DIAGRAM.png` in repository (exported from draw.io / dbdiagram / Mermaid), or
     - Add `ER_DIAGRAM.mmd` (Mermaid) that can be rendered.

6. Relational Schema
   - `database.py` contains `CREATE TABLE` statements in `create_tables()` which can be exported as a `DDL.sql` file.

7. DDL Commands
   - DDL is generated by `database.py` on initialization. There is no `ddl.sql` file by default; you can run the dump in MySQL or extract from `database.py` into a `ddl_commands.sql` file.

8. CRUD operation Screenshots
   - Not present. Take screenshots of GUI flows (account creation, transaction, loan application, etc.) and add them to `screenshots/`.

9. List of functionalities/features of the application and its associated screenshots using front end
   - Functional descriptions are in `USER_REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md`. Add screenshots to `screenshots/` and reference them in the report.

10. Triggers, Procedures/Functions, Nested query, Join, Aggregate queries
    - Present as SQL files:
      - `database_triggers.sql` (triggers)
      - `database_procedures.sql` (procedures and functions)
      - `complex_queries.sql` (nested/join/aggregate queries)

11. Code snippets for invoking the Procedures/Functions/Trigger
    - `database.py` attempts to load procedures and triggers in `create_procedures_and_triggers()` by reading `database_procedures.sql` and `database_triggers.sql`.
    - Example invocation: `CALL TransferMoney(from_account_id, to_account_id, amount, @status); SELECT @status;` — add to `CODE_SNIPPETS.md` (not present).

12. SQL queries (Create, Insert, Triggers, Procedures/Functions, Nested query, Join, Aggregate queries) in the form of .sql files
    - Present files:
      - `database_procedures.sql`
      - `database_triggers.sql`
      - `complex_queries.sql`
      - `database_users.sql` (user creation & privileges)
    - Note: `database.py` currently reads procedures and triggers, but does not automatically execute `database_users.sql` or `complex_queries.sql`.

13. Github repo link
    - Not present. Add your repo URL (e.g., in `README.md`).

---

## Status & Recommended Next Steps
- Done: `USER_REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` created and added to repository.
- Present: procedure, trigger, complex query and user SQL files exist in repository.
- Missing/Action items:
  1. Add ER diagram file (`ER_DIAGRAM.png` or `ER_DIAGRAM.mmd`).
  2. Export DDL SQL file (`ddl_commands.sql`) by extracting the `CREATE TABLE` statements or by dumping DB after creation.
  3. Add `CODE_SNIPPETS.md` with examples of calling stored procedures and expected outputs.
  4. Add screenshots to `screenshots/` and link them from the report.
  5. Add cover page file `COVER_PAGE.md` and ensure `README.md` contains the GitHub link.
  6. Optionally update `database.py` to also load `database_users.sql` and `complex_queries.sql` at initialization (I can do this for you).

## Quick How-to for final assembly
1. Create screenshots of GUI pages by running:

```powershell
# in project root (Windows PowerShell)
streamlit run app.py
```

Then capture the relevant pages in the browser and save to `screenshots/`.

2. Export ER diagram to `ER_DIAGRAM.png` and add it to the repo.

3. Create `final_report.pdf` by combining markdown files and images (use pandoc or a Word processor):

```powershell
# Example (requires pandoc installed):
pandoc COVER_PAGE.md PROJECT_REPORT.md USER_REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md DELIVERABLES.md -o final_report.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

4. Add GitHub repo link to `README.md` and push.

---

If you'd like, I can now:
- create a `ddl_commands.sql` file by extracting the CREATE TABLE statements from `database.py`,
- update `database.py` to execute `database_users.sql` and `complex_queries.sql` in `create_procedures_and_triggers()` (so all .sql files are executed during setup),
- add a template `CODE_SNIPPETS.md` with CALL examples for procedures/functions/triggers.

Tell me which follow-up actions you'd like me to take next.
